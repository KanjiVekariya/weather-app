I developed a weather desktop application using python.
I used tkinter for GUI and develop very minimalistic and basic UI for weather application 
You have to enter your city name and you will get the all weather information about your city like what kind of weather in your city then temperature,humidity,wind speed.
I used https://lnkd.in/gfMrpksz openweather API for real time information of weather of any city
